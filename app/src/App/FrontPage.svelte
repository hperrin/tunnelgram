      An
      <strong>end to end encrypted</strong>
      (E2EE) messenger that works on multiple devices at the same time. Talk to your
      friends with the peace of mind that no one else can see.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      {$brand} messages, photos, and videos are
      <strong>encrypted on your device,</strong>
      and can
      <strong>only be decrypted by the recipients on their device.</strong>
      Not Facebook, Google, Verizon, or AT&amp;T; not even {$brand}'s own
      servers. Only your friends and you.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      Unlike with other E2EE messengers, you can
      <strong>log in on all your devices at the same time.</strong>
      Start a chat on your phone, continue it on your laptop, then watch that video
      from your friend on your tablet. If you
      <strong>lose your phone, your data isn't lost</strong>
      with it; just log in on your new phone, and all your stuff is there.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      Also, unlike with other popular secured messengers,
      <strong>getting a new phone doesn't require you to do anything</strong>
      other than log in on the new phone. There's no need to

      <strong>{$brand} just works like a messenger should.</strong>

      {$brand} is
      <a href="https://github.com/hperrin/tunnelgram" target="_blank">
        fully open source
      </a>
      (server and client) and uses the

      so you can see
      <em>all</em>
      of the code it's built on.

    <p class="card-text">
      {$brand} is not a big corporation. It's built by me,
      <a href="https://github.com/hperrin" target="_blank">Hunter Perrin.</a>
      I've been writing software for over two decades. I've worked at Facebook and
      Google, and I know who can see the messages you send over their platforms.
      It's scary. It took me 5 years of weekends and spare time to develop the technologies,
      and it's now the most convenient end to end encrypted messenger.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      {$brand} is hosted at my expense, so I hope to offset the cost through
      <a href="https://www.patreon.com/tunnelgram" target="_blank">Patreon.</a>
      Basically, the more I make through Patreon, the more time and resources I can
      devote to {$brand}. If I make enough to hire more people, we can make {$brand}
      a world scale messenger!
