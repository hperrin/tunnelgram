      An <strong>end to end encrypted</strong> (E2EE) messenger that works on
      multiple devices at the same time. Talk to your friends with the peace of
      mind that no one else can see.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      {$brand} messages, photos, and videos are <strong>encrypted on your
      device</strong>, and can <strong>only be decrypted by the recipients on
      their device</strong>. Not Facebook, Google, Verizon, or AT&amp;T; not even
      {$brand}'s own servers. Only your friends and you.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      Unlike with other E2EE messengers, you can <strong>log in on multiple
      devices at the same time</strong>. Start a conversation on your phone,
      continue it on your laptop, then watch that video from your friend on your
      tablet. If you <strong>lose your phone, your conversations aren't
      lost</strong> with it; just log in on your new phone, and all your stuff
      is there.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      Also, unlike with other popular secured messengers, <strong>getting a new
      phone doesn't require you to do anything</strong> other than log in on the
      new phone. There's no need to
      <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007062012" target="_blank">leave
      any groups, unregister any numbers, tell your contacts
      about your new phone</a>, or
      <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/28000018/?category=5245246" target="_blank">transfer
      anything from your old phone</a>. <strong>Tunnelgram just works, like a
      messenger should.</strong>

      {$brand} is
      <a href="https://github.com/hperrin/tunnelgram" target="_blank">fully open source</a>
      (server and client) and uses the
      <a href="https://github.com/hperrin/tunnelgram/blob/master/README.md#the-tunnelwire-encryption-scheme" target="_blank">Tunnelwire Encryption Scheme</a>,
      so you can check <em>all</em> of the code it's built on.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      {$brand} is not a big corporation. It's built by me,
      <a href="https://github.com/hperrin" target="_blank">Hunter Perrin</a>.
      I've been writing software for over two decades. I've worked at Facebook
      and Google, and I know who can see the messages you send over their
      platforms. It's scary. It took me 5 years of weekends and spare time to
      develop the technologies, and it's now the most convenient end to end
      encrypted messenger.

    <p class="card-text">
      {$brand} is hosted at my expense, so I hope to offset the cost through
      <a href="https://www.patreon.com/tunnelgram" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.
      Basically, the more I make through Patreon, the more time and resources I
      can devote to {$brand}. If I make enough to hire more people, we can make
      {$brand} a world scale messenger!

      Your encryption is only as strong as your password, so choose a good one.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text">
      If you lose your password, your messages are gone forever. Seriously, this
      is how secure it is. Without your password, your messages are
      <strong>unreadable</strong>!
